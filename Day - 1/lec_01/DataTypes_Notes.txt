# Java Data Types Notes

Data types in Java specify the size and type of values that can be stored in an identifier. Java is a statically-typed language, meaning all variables must be declared before they can be used.

There are two main categories of data types in Java:

1.  **Primitive Data Types**
2.  **Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types**

## 1. Primitive Data Types
These are the building blocks of data manipulation in Java. There are 8 primitive data types:

### A. Numeric Types

#### Integral Types (Whole Numbers)
1.  **byte**
    *   Size: 1 byte (8 bits)
    *   Range: -128 to 127
    *   Default Value: 0
    *   Use: Saving memory in large arrays.

2.  **short**
    *   Size: 2 bytes (16 bits)
    *   Range: -32,768 to 32,767
    *   Default Value: 0
    *   Use: Also for saving memory, slightly larger range than byte.

3.  **int** (Most commonly used)
    *   Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
    *   Range: -2^31 to 2^31-1 (approx -2 billion to 2 billion)
    *   Default Value: 0

4.  **long**
    *   Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
    *   Range: -2^63 to 2^63-1
    *   Default Value: 0L
    *   Use: When a wider range than `int` is needed. Note the 'L' suffix (e.g., `long a = 100000L;`).

#### Floating-Point Types (Decimal Numbers)
5.  **float**
    *   Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
    *   Range: Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
    *   Default Value: 0.0f
    *   Use: Saving memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. Note the 'f' suffix (e.g., `float f = 5.75f;`).

6.  **double** (Default for decimals)
    *   Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
    *   Range: Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
    *   Default Value: 0.0d

### B. Character Type
7.  **char**
    *   Size: 2 bytes (16 bits)
    *   Range: 0 to 65,535 (unsigned)
    *   Default Value: '\u0000' (null character)
    *   Use: Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values (e.g., `char letter = 'A';`).

### C. Boolean Type
8.  **boolean**
    *   Size: Virtual Machine dependent (usually 1 bit of information, but size isn't precisely defined)
    *   Values: `true` or `false`
    *   Default Value: `false`
    *   Use: Conditional logic and flags.

## 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
These refer to objects and are created by the programmer (except for String). They store the memory address (reference) of the object, not the value itself.

*   **String**: A sequence of characters (e.g., `String text = "Hello";`). In Java, Strings are objects, not primitives.
*   **Arrays**: A collection of similar types of data (e.g., `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};`).
*   **Classes**: User-defined blueprints for objects.
*   **Interfaces**: Abstract types used to specify a behavior that classes must implement.

### Key Differences between Primitive and Non-Primitive:
*   Primitives are predefined in Java; Non-primitives are created by the programmer (except String).
*   Non-primitives can call methods to perform operations; Primitives cannot.
*   Primitives always have a value; Non-primitives can be `null`.
*   Primitives start with a lowercase letter; Non-primitives typically start with an uppercase letter.
